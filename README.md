# Crop Yield Prediction Model
Welcome to the Crop Yield Prediction API project! This project aims to provide a convenient and efficient way to predict crop yields based on historical agricultural data, weather patterns, soil conditions, and crop management practices. The API utilizes a Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model trained on a dataset containing information such as the area of cultivation, type of crop, year of observation, average rainfall, pesticides usage, and average temperature. With this API, users can easily make predictions by sending HTTP GET requests to the designated endpoint, providing the necessary input parameters. Whether you're a farmer, agricultural researcher, or enthusiast, this API can assist you in optimizing farming strategies, making informed decisions, and ultimately improving crop yield outcomes. Get started by following the instructions in the documentation and explore the possibilities of leveraging predictive analytics for agriculture with our Crop Yield Prediction API.
